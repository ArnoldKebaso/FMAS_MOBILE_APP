Flood Monitoring and Alert System (FMAS)
========================================

_Disaster Recovery, Flood Alert & Response System_

The Flood Monitoring and Alert System (FMAS) is a comprehensive digital platform designed to mitigate the impact of floods in Kenya. The system is targeted at vulnerable communities—particularly the Budalangi community—and is aimed at enhancing flood preparedness, reporting, and response. FMAS leverages real-time data collection, predictive analytics, geospatial mapping, and multi-channel communication (SMS and email) to provide timely alerts, facilitate incident reporting, and disseminate educational resources for flood preparedness and recovery.
